        /// The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit; however, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the memory parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. This parameter maps to MemoryReservation in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory-reservation option to docker run. You must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of memory or memoryReservation in container definitions. If you specify both, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed; otherwise, the value of memory is used. For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time, you can set a memoryReservation of 128 MiB, and a memory hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container instance, but also allow the container to consume more memory resources when needed.
        public let memoryReservation: Int32?
        /// The list of port mappings for the container. Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container instance to send or receive traffic. This parameter maps to PortBindings in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --publish option to docker run. If the network mode of a task definition is set to none, then you cannot specify port mappings. If the network mode of a task definition is set to host, then host ports must either be undefined or they must match the container port in the port mapping.  After a task reaches the RUNNING status, manual and automatic host and container port assignments are visible in the Network Bindings section of a container description of a selected task in the Amazon ECS console, or the networkBindings section DescribeTasks responses. 
        public let portMappings: [PortMapping]?
        /// The number of cpu units reserved for the container. A container instance has 1,024 cpu units for every CPU core. This parameter specifies the minimum amount of CPU to reserve for a container, and containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run.  You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the Amazon EC2 Instances detail page by 1,024.  For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. The Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see CPU share constraint in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2; however, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:    Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to 2 CPU shares.    Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.  
        public let cpu: Int32?

You must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of memory or memoryReservation in container definitions. If you specify both, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed; otherwise, the value of memory is used.

To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.  Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type).
