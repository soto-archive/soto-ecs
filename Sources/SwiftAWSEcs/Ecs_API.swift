/**
Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-enabled applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles. You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.

If you intend to use the container instance for some other purpose after deregistration, you should stop all of the tasks running on the container instance before deregistration to avoid any orphaned tasks from consuming resources. Deregistering a container instance removes the instance from a cluster, but it does not terminate the EC2 instance; if you are finished using the instance, be sure to terminate it in the Amazon EC2 console to stop billing.  If you terminate a running container instance, Amazon ECS automatically deregisters the instance from your cluster (stopped container instances or instances with disconnected agents are not automatically deregistered when terminated).

    ///  Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance. You can change the status of a container instance to DRAINING to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.  When you set a container instance to DRAINING, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the PENDING state are stopped immediately. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the RUNNING state are stopped and replaced according the service's deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent. Note that you can change the deployment configuration of your service using UpdateService.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during task replacement. For example, desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch size. For example, if desiredCount of four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.   Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a service are not affected; you must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING tasks. You can verify this using ListTasks. When you set a container instance to ACTIVE, the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

    ///  Modifies the desired count, deployment configuration, or task definition used in a service. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. You can use UpdateService to modify your task definition and deploy a new version of your service. You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).   When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout, after which SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic:   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy):   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.     When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic:    Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.   Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.

    ///  Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below desiredCount, Amazon ECS spawns another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see UpdateService. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing in the Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide. You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. During a deployment (which is triggered by changing the task definition or the desired count of a service with an UpdateService operation), the service scheduler uses the minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent parameters to determine the deployment strategy. The minimumHealthyPercent represents a lower limit on the number of your service's tasks that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desiredCount (rounded up to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desiredCount of four tasks and a minimumHealthyPercent of 50%, the scheduler can stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimumHealthyPercent is 50% in the console and 100% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs. The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of your service's tasks that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desiredCount (rounded down to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desiredCount of four tasks and a maximumPercent value of 200%, the scheduler can start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximumPercent is 200%. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
